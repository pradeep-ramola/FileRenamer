# FileRenamer
while working with the some reports  faced the file naming issue like for eg : we saved the files as The ABC Council - XYZ June 24 MNC.docx but later after discussion we realized that we should save the files name with May (The ABC Council - XYZ May 24 MNC.docx) instead of June  at that time we didn't find any solution so had to do it manually . in order to get the rid of manual work wrote the console app which can rename the files so  as per the keyword for eg : first it will ask the files location which needs to be renamed after that it will ask the keyword which we want to replace and finally with what keyword we want to replace (thought that it would be helpful for others as well please feel free to use it )
